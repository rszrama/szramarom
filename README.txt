SzramaRom is an effort to bring new life to the Rom MUD codebase. It has long been
my favorite MUD codebase, and over the years I have often started it up locally to
run around to the old familiar areas. I'm sure there are others out there like me,
so feel free to speak up and pitch in!

Goals:

* Fix known bugs in the Rom codebase.
* Patch in the major features released over the years.
* Spice up the stock Rom areas with Mob Programs.
* Target generic races and classes for inclusion.

Currently patched in:

* This MUD started from the QuickMud codebase, which includes color, an advanced
  noteboard, and OLC with Mob Programs.
* Scan has been fixed, Donate added in, and minimal Autodamage support.
* Vassago's quest code with a questmaster added in the upstairs room of the
  Grunting Boar Inn in Midgaard.
* A beefier 'prompt all' and an autotick feature to display tick notifications.
